# MyReads Project

In this project I'm using resources from the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course (https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). 

To start the project I used the *npx create-react-app* command to get an updated react package, one of the possible options to make a valid project.
